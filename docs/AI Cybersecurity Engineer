# The AI Security Engineer Bootcamp & Certification Ladder
**Delivered by StFrancis Labs**

Artificial intelligence systems now operate in adversarial, high-stakes environments: they make decisions, invoke tools, control workflows, and increasingly act autonomously. As these systems scale, their **failure modes scale with them**.

Yet most training programs still treat AI security as an afterthought—either bolted onto traditional cybersecurity or reduced to abstract ML theory.

**StFrancis Labs exists to fix that.**

This bootcamp is a **project-driven, enterprise-grade training and certification program** designed to produce engineers who can **design, attack, defend, govern, and deploy secure AI systems at scale**.

---

## Program Overview

**Program Name:** AI Security Engineer Bootcamp
**Delivered by:** StFrancis Labs
**Format:** Modular · Cohort-based or Self-Paced
**Duration:** 18–24 months

**Outcome Pathway:**
AI Security Engineer → Principal Engineer → Architect / Founder

**Teaching Model:**
**Build → Break → Defend → Govern**

This is not a shortcut program. It is a **systems-level apprenticeship**.

---

## Why This Program Exists

Most AI and cybersecurity programs fail in the same ways:

- AI is taught without adversaries
- Security is taught without models, agents, or data pipelines
- Systems are fragmented into silos
- Governance is discussed but never engineered

In real deployments, AI failures emerge from **interactions** between models, data, infrastructure, agents, users, incentives, and attackers.

This program trains engineers to reason about **entire AI systems under adversarial pressure**.

- Oral defense (recorded or live)
- Explicit failure analysis

There are **no multiple-choice-only certifications**.

---

## 💰 Pricing Strategy (Realistic & Market-Aligned)

- Associate certifications: **$300–$600**
- Specialist certifications: **$800–$1,500**
- Architect-level certification: **$2,000–$3,500**

---

## 🧠 Positioning Statement

> “This program certifies engineers who can **design, attack, defend, govern, and deploy secure AI systems at scale**.”

This is the standard StFrancis Labs enforces.

---

## Why StFrancis Labs

StFrancis Labs was founded on a simple belief:

> **Intelligence without control is a liability.**

As AI systems grow more powerful, security is no longer optional, reactive, or peripheral. It is foundational. This program exists to train engineers who can keep pace with capability **without sacrificing responsibility**.

---

## Conclusion: Security Is the Cost of Intelligence

The future will not be secured by those who merely *use* AI tools, but by those who understand their limits, incentives, and adversarial dynamics.

That is the engineer this program trains.
