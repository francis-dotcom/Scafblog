# Student Equipment Requirements
## StFrancis Labs AI Security Engineer Bootcamp

**Delivered by StFrancis Labs**

---

## Why These Requirements Matter

This is not a theoretical program. You will build real systems, attack production-grade models, and defend against live adversaries. The hardware and software listed below are not suggestions—they are minimum requirements to participate successfully.

If you arrive with underpowered equipment, you will fall behind immediately. There are no exceptions.
