# AI Security Engineer Bootcamp & Certification Ladder

**Delivered by StFrancis Labs**

---

## The Problem Nobody's Solving

AI systems now make autonomous decisions in production environments. They approve loans, diagnose diseases, control infrastructure, and interact with millions of users daily. When these systems fail, the consequences are not theoretical — they are financial, legal, and reputational.

Yet most AI engineers graduate without understanding:
- How adversaries manipulate model predictions
- Why prompt injection defeats LLM guardrails
- How to verify robustness mathematically
- When federated learning preserves privacy
- Which attacks scale with model capability

**This is not a gap. It is a crisis.**

Traditional cybersecurity training does not cover AI attack surfaces. AI and machine learning courses ignore adversarial threat models. The result is production systems deployed by engineers who have never seen an adversarial example, never tested a jailbreak, and never quantified model risk.

**We built this program to fix that.**

---

## What This Program Actually Is

This is not a certificate farm.  
This is not “10 hours to AI security mastery.”  
This is not theory without implementation.

**This is a systems-level apprenticeship.**

You will build production-grade security tools from scratch. You will break state-of-the-art models. You will design defenses that hold against real attacks. You will quantify risk in dollar terms executives understand.

**Format:** Modular curriculum with cohort-based learning and self-paced options  
**Duration:** 18–24 months for the complete ladder  
**Philosophy:** Build → Break → Defend → Govern  
**Validation:** Project-based certification with oral defense

If you are looking for shortcuts, this program is not for you.

## Program Architecture

### The Certification Ladder

Each level produces **one enterprise-grade project** and maps directly to a real industry role.

- **C-AISSA** — Certified AI Systems Security Associate  
- **C-AMLE** — Certified Adversarial ML Engineer  
- **C-LASS** — Certified LLM & Agent Security Specialist  
- **C-AICDE** — Certified AI Cyber Defense Engineer  
- **C-AIRTO** — Certified AI Red Team Operator  
- **C-AIRGP** — Certified AI Risk & Governance Professional  
- **C-AISA** — Certified AI Security Architect  
- **C-PAISE** — Certified Principal AI Security Engineer  

You may stop at any level or complete the full ladder.

## Detailed Curriculum (Project-Oriented)

### Module 0 — AI Systems Security Foundations  
**Certification:** C-AISSA  
**Timeline:** 2–4 weeks

**Enterprise Project:** Secure AI System Threat Model

Students deliver a full security baseline for a production AI system, including:
- Threat model
- Attack surface map
- Risk register
- Remediation roadmap

**Outcome:**  
> “I can explain how an AI system fails before it is attacked.”

---

### Module 1 — Adversarial Machine Learning  
**Certification:** C-AMLE  
**Timeline:** 8–10 weeks

**Enterprise Project:** Adversarial Robustness Evaluation Platform

Students implement multiple adversarial attacks, evaluate transferability, and build a robustness dashboard with executive risk summaries.

**Outcome:**  
> “I can measure and communicate model robustness under adversarial pressure.”

---

### Module 2 — LLM & Autonomous Agent Security  
**Certification:** C-LASS  
**Timeline:** 8–10 weeks

**Enterprise Project:** LLM & Agent Security Gateway

---

### Module 3 — AI-Powered Cyber Defense  
**Certification:** C-AICDE  
**Timeline:** 10–12 weeks

**Enterprise Project:** AI Threat Detection System

Students build a real-time ML-driven defense system such as:
- Malware detection
- Network intrusion detection
- Behavioral anomaly detection

Performance targets:
- Detection accuracy above ninety-five percent
- Sub-millisecond inference latency on high-throughput traffic

**Outcome:**  
> “I can deploy AI systems that defend real environments at scale.”

---

### Module 4 — Offensive AI & Red Teaming  
**Certification:** C-AIRTO  
**Timeline:** 10–12 weeks

**Enterprise Project:** AI Red Team Automation Platform

Students simulate real adversaries targeting AI systems through:
- Model extraction
- Data poisoning
- Backdoor attacks
- Prompt injection campaigns

**Outcome:**  
> “I can simulate realistic attackers against AI systems.”

---

### Module 5 — AI Governance, Risk & Compliance  
**Certification:** C-AIRGP  
**Timeline:** 6–8 weeks

**Enterprise Project:** AI Governance & Risk Engine

Students build a governance platform with:
- Model lineage tracking
- Risk scoring
- Bias auditing
- Regulatory mapping
- Audit evidence generation

**Outcome:**  
> “I can translate AI security into regulatory and business language.”

---

### Module 6 — AI Security Architecture  
**Certification:** C-AISA  
**Timeline:** 6–8 weeks

**Enterprise Projects:**
- AI Threat Economics Simulator
- Formal Robustness Certification Tool

Students quantify risk in dollar terms and produce mathematically justified robustness guarantees.

**Outcome:**  
> “I can design secure AI systems from first principles.”

---

### Module 7 — Principal Capstone  
**Certification:** C-PAISE  
**Timeline:** 4–6 months

**Capstone Options:**
- Zero-Trust AI Security Platform
- Comprehensive AI Red Team Suite
- Publishable Industry Benchmark

**Mandatory:**
- Production-grade system
- Live demo
- Full threat model
- Executive briefing
- Oral defense

**Outcome:**  
> “I operate at principal or founder level in AI security.”

---

## Certification Validation Model

Every certification requires:
1. Enterprise project delivery  
2. Live attack and defense demonstration  
3. Written threat model  
4. Failure analysis  
5. Oral defense before StFrancis Labs reviewers  

No multiple-choice exams. No shortcuts.

## The StFrancis Labs Thesis

**Intelligence without control is a liability.**

AI systems learn, adapt, and act. Security cannot be bolted on later. It must be designed from first principles.

This program trains engineers who can:
- Think adversarially
- Design defensible systems
- Quantify risk
- Communicate with executives
- Operate responsibly at scale

---

## Final Note

This program is difficult by design.

It exists for engineers willing to accept responsibility for securing systems that shape real outcomes in the world.

**Security is the cost of intelligence.**
