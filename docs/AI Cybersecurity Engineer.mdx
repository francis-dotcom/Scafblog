# AI Security Engineer Bootcamp & Certification Ladder
### Delivered by StFrancis Labs

AI systems now operate in adversarial environments—making decisions, controlling workflows, and acting autonomously. Their failure modes scale alongside their capabilities.

Most training programs treat AI security as an afterthought. **This program fixes that.**

## 🎯 Program Overview

| Detail | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Format** | Modular · Cohort/Self-Paced |
| **Duration** | 18–24 months |
| **Outcome** | AI Security Engineer → Principal → Architect |
| **Model** | Build → Break → Defend → Govern |

*This is a systems-level apprenticeship, not a shortcut.*
