# AI Security Engineer Bootcamp & Certification Ladder

**Delivered by StFrancis Labs**

---

## The Problem Nobody's Solving

AI systems now make autonomous decisions in production environments. They approve loans, diagnose diseases, control infrastructure, and interact with millions of users daily. When these systems fail, the consequences aren't theoretical—they're financial, legal, and reputational.

Yet most AI engineers graduate without understanding:
- How adversaries manipulate model predictions
- Why prompt injection defeats LLM guardrails
- How to verify robustness mathematically
- When federated learning preserves privacy
- Which attacks scale with model capability

**This isn't a gap. It's a crisis.**

Traditional cybersecurity training doesn't cover AI attack surfaces. AI/ML courses ignore adversarial threat models. The result: production systems deployed by engineers who've never seen an adversarial example, never tested a jailbreak, never quantified model risk.

**We built this program to fix that.**

---

## What This Program Actually Is

This is not a certificate farm. This is not "10 hours to AI security mastery." This is not theory without implementation.

**This is a systems-level apprenticeship.**

You will build production-grade security tools from scratch. You will break state-of-the-art models. You will design defenses that hold against real attacks. You will quantify risk in dollar terms executives understand.

**Format:** Modular curriculum with cohort-based learning and self-paced options  
**Duration:** 18–24 months for complete ladder  
**Philosophy:** Build → Break → Defend → Govern  
**Validation:** Project-based certification with oral defense  

This program assumes you're serious. It assumes you have time. It assumes you want to operate at the intersection of AI capability and security necessity.

If you're looking for shortcuts, this isn't it.

---

## Certification Validation Model

We don't do multiple-choice exams. We don't do take-home tests you can outsource. We validate real capability.

**Every certification requires:**

**1. Project Submission**  
Working code with documentation. Must demonstrate technical depth and operational understanding.

**2. Attack/Defense Demonstration**  
Live demo showing your system under adversarial conditions. Prove it works when attacked.

**3. Threat Model Documentation**  
Written analysis of attack vectors, mitigations, and residual risk. Show strategic thinking.

**4. Oral Defense**  
30–60 minute technical interview. Defend your design decisions. Answer hard questions.

**5. Failure Analysis**  
Document what didn't work. Explain limitations. Demonstrate intellectual honesty.

**Why This Model:**
Anyone can memorize facts. We validate engineering judgment—the ability to make correct security decisions under uncertainty with incomplete information. That's what separates senior engineers from beginners.

## The StFrancis Labs Thesis

### Why We Built This

We founded StFrancis Labs on a simple premise:

**Intelligence without control is a liability.**

AI capability is accelerating. Security is not keeping pace. The gap creates systemic risk: deployed systems vulnerable to manipulation, extraction, and misuse. Organizations rush to adopt AI without understanding threat models. Engineers ship code without adversarial testing.

This isn't sustainable.

As AI systems grow more capable, security becomes foundational—not optional. You can't bolt security onto autonomous agents after deployment. You can't patch away prompt injection. You can't fix architectural vulnerabilities with monitoring.

**Security must be designed in from first principles.**

This program exists because the industry needs engineers who understand:
- How AI systems fail under adversarial pressure
- When theoretical attacks become practical threats  
- Why certain architectures resist certain attacks
- What security means in systems that learn and adapt

We're not training security theater consultants. We're training engineers who can design, implement, and defend production AI systems that operate in hostile environments.

**Because capability without security is recklessness.**

## What Happens Next

If you've read this far, you're taking this seriously. Good.

The AI security skills gap is real. Organizations are deploying powerful systems without adequate security review. Engineers are shipping code they can't properly test. Executives are making risk decisions with incomplete information.

This program gives you the skills to fix that.

**You will learn to:**
- Think adversarially about AI systems
- Quantify risk in operational terms
- Design defensible architectures
- Communicate security to non-technical stakeholders
- Operate at the frontier of AI safety

**What we expect from you:**
- Intellectual honesty about limitations
- Willingness to be wrong and learn
- Commitment to completing what you start
- Ethical responsibility in applying these skills

**What you get from us:**
- Technical depth that passes peer review
- Project feedback from practicing engineers
- Certifications with market credibility
- Network of AI security professionals
- Skills that compound in value

---

## Final Note

This isn't easy. It's not meant to be.

We're training engineers to secure systems that most people don't fully understand. Systems that make autonomous decisions. Systems where failure cascades. Systems where getting security wrong has consequences measured in dollars, lawsuits, and headlines.

If that sounds interesting—if that sounds like the work you want to do—apply.

If it sounds overwhelming, consider whether you're ready for this responsibility.

**Security is the cost of intelligence.**

Someone has to pay it. Make sure you're one of the people qualified to present the bill.
