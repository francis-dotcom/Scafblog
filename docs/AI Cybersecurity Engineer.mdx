# AI Security Engineer Bootcamp & Certification Ladder

**Delivered by StFrancis Labs**

---

## The Problem Nobody Is Solving

AI systems now make autonomous decisions in production environments. They approve loans, diagnose diseases, control infrastructure, and interact with millions of users every day.

When these systems fail, the consequences are not theoretical. They are financial, legal, and reputational.

Yet many AI engineers graduate without understanding:

- How adversaries manipulate model predictions  
- Why prompt injection defeats LLM guardrails  
- How robustness can be validated rigorously  
- When federated learning actually preserves privacy  
- Which attacks scale with model capability  

**This is not a gap. It is a crisis.**

Traditional cybersecurity training ignores AI-specific attack surfaces.  
AI and machine learning programs avoid adversarial threat models.

The result is production AI systems deployed by engineers who have never broken a model, never defended one under pressure, and never quantified AI risk.

**This program exists to fix that.**

## What This Program Actually Is

This is not a certificate farm.  
This is not a short crash course.  
This is not theory without consequence.

**This is a systems-level apprenticeship.**

Participants build production-grade security systems, attack real models, deploy defenses under pressure, and explain failures in language executives understand.

### Program Format
- Modular curriculum  
- Cohort-based and self-paced tracks  

### Duration
- Eighteen to twenty-four months for the full certification ladder  

### Methodology
- Build  
- Break  
- Defend  
- Govern  

### Validation Model
- Enterprise projects  
- Mandatory lab exams  
- Oral defense  

If you want shortcuts, this program is not for you.

## The StFrancis Labs Thesis

**Intelligence without control is a liability.**

AI systems learn, adapt, and act. Security must be designed from first principles, not bolted on later.

This program produces engineers who:
- Think adversarially  
- Design defensible systems  
- Quantify risk  
- Communicate with executives  
- Operate responsibly at scale  

---

## Final Note

This program is difficult by design.

It exists for engineers willing to accept responsibility for securing systems that shape real-world outcomes.

**Security is the cost of intelligence.**
