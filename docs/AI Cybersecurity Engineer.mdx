# AI Security Engineer Bootcamp & Certification Ladder

**Delivered by StFrancis Labs**

---

## The Problem Nobody Is Solving

AI systems now make autonomous decisions in production environments. They approve loans, diagnose diseases, control infrastructure, and interact with millions of users every day. When these systems fail, the consequences are not theoretical — they are financial, legal, and reputational.

Yet many AI engineers graduate without understanding:
- How adversaries manipulate model predictions
- Why prompt injection defeats LLM guardrails
- How robustness can be verified mathematically
- When federated learning actually preserves privacy
- Which attacks scale with model capability

**This is not a gap. It is a crisis.**

Traditional cybersecurity training does not cover AI attack surfaces. AI and machine learning courses ignore adversarial threat models. The result is production systems deployed by engineers who have never seen an adversarial example, never tested a jailbreak, and never quantified model risk.

**We built this program to fix that.**

---

## What This Program Actually Is

This is not a certificate farm.  
This is not “ten hours to AI security mastery.”  
This is not theory without implementation.

**This is a systems-level apprenticeship.**

You will build production-grade security tools from scratch. You will break state-of-the-art models. You will design defenses that hold under real attacks. You will quantify risk in terms executives understand.

**Format:** Modular curriculum with cohort-based learning and self-paced options  
**Duration:** Eighteen to twenty-four months for the complete ladder  
**Philosophy:** Build → Break → Defend → Govern  
**Validation:** Project-based certification with oral defense

If you are looking for shortcuts, this program is not for you.

## The StFrancis Labs Thesis

**Intelligence without control is a liability.**

AI systems learn, adapt, and act. Security cannot be bolted on later. It must be designed from first principles.

This program trains engineers who can:
- Think adversarially
- Design defensible systems
- Quantify risk
- Communicate with executives
- Operate responsibly at scale

---

## Final Note

This program is difficult by design.

It exists for engineers willing to accept responsibility for securing systems that shape real outcomes in the world.

**Security is the cost of intelligence.**
