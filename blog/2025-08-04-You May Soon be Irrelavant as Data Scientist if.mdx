# ðŸš¨ The Data Science Reality Check: Your $50K Skills Are About to Be Worthless (Unless You Do This)

**The data science job market just shifted. Most data scientists don't realize they're already obsolete.**

You spent months learning pandas and scikit-learn. You built a portfolio. You landed your first data science job at $65K. You thought you made it.

**Then ChatGPT happened. Then Claude happened. Then every business analyst started calling themselves a "data scientist."**

Now companies are asking: _"Why pay a data scientist $120K when our intern can use ChatGPT to build the same model in 30 minutes?"_

**Here's the uncomfortable truth:** The data science gold rush is over. The market is flooded with junior data scientists who all have the same basic skills. **But there's still a path to 7-figure earningsâ€”if you know where to look.**
